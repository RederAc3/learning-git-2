        <p>I wanna feel the same now
            I wanna feel the same
            as when you stood next to me
            stood next to me</p>
        <p>There was a time I knew how
            There was a time I knew how
            Sweet your kiss could be
            Your kiss could be</p>
        <p>I remember every smile
            Every little smile
            And every ride just with you
            Ride just with you
            If you stay a little while
            I'll find the place just for me and you
            Trust me, itâ€™s true</p>
