        <p>I wanna feel the same now
            I wanna feel the same
            as when you stood next to me
            stood next to me</p>
        <p>There was a time I knew how
            There was a time I knew how
            Sweet your kiss could be
            Your kiss could be</p>
        <p>I remember every smile
            Every little smile
            And every ride just with you
            Ride just with you
            If you stay a little while
            I'll find the place just for me and you
            Trust me, it’s true</p>

        <p>Maybe you can’t understand
            Slow down a bit for me
            Take me to wonderland
            Go where we want to be
            When we get there at night
            Let’s stay there for a week
            Just wanna feel so close to you</p>

        <p>Baby please understand
            Slow down a bit for me
            Take me to wonderland
            Go where we want to be
            When we get there at night
            Let’s stay there for a week
            Just wanna feel so close to you</p>

        <p>I wanna see that girl now
            I wanna see that girl
            I saw on the crowded street
            On the crowded street</p>

        <p>There was a time you knew how
            There was a time you knew how to make my life complete
            make my life complete</p>

        <p>Still remember every smile
            Every little smile
            And every ride just with you
            Ride just with you
            If you stay a little while
            I'll find the place just for me and you
            Trust me, it’s true</p>

        <p>Maybe you can’t understand
            Slow down a bit for me
            Take me to wonderland
            Go where we want to be
            When we get there at night
            Let’s stay there for a week
            Just wanna feel so close to you</p>

        <p>Baby please understand
